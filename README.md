So what have we learned in those 2 lessons?
- Override method (invoke child class method) vs not override method (invoke parent method)
- Importance of using the @Override annotation
- recap: method overriding vs method overloading
- reacp: super vs this
- Reference vs value type (deep copy vs shallow copy) and heap vs stack
- Static methods and variables
- Encapsulation and access modifiers: public, private protected and default (package private- not specifing any access modifier).
- access modifiers allowed in top level elements (class, interface and enum) are only public and default. In memebers such as variables and methods all access modifiers allowed.
- Scopes: class scope, method scope, block scope (if, else, loops). Variables that declared inside of inner scope are not accessible from outside
  (For example declaring method inside a method, we can't access it from the class, only from inside of the method in which he declared).
- Final variables (variables can be static and final together)
