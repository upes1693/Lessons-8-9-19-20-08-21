//final variable is a constant variable that can be initialized only when we declare it
//or within the constructor, it's value is constant and can't be changed after initialization
//final variables are instance variables meaning each instance will have its own copy
//unlike static variable
//we can use final and static together in case it's constant shared value between all instances
//Naming convention- final variables will be named with only capital letters and _ between words
//for example SOME_VALUE
